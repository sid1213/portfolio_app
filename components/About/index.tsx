              I have experience in website design, branding, art, and graphic
              and UI/UX design. I&apos;ve collaborated with brands and agencies
              to develop their visual identities for use across a variety of
              social media channels, in addition to producing product websites,
              illustrations, and logos for numerous companies. I enjoy
              traveling, drawing, sketching, and going on adventures. I also
              enjoy solving problems in design. I enjoy learning something new
              every day.
